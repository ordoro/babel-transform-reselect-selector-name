# babel-transform-reselect-selector-name

[experiment]

Transform calls to `reselect` `createSelector` to call with `name` as the first argument. Combine with a modified `reselect` library to debug `reselect` performance.


package.json and test structure mostly copypasta'd from https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform.
